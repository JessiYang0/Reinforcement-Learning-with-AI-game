# Reinforcement-Learning-with-AI-game

To design a neural network for simulating and playing the game Halite by Two Sigma using an Actor-Critic agent, let's outline the steps and components involved in creating this AI model. The Actor-Critic model, a reinforcement learning approach, consists of two main components:

* Actor: Determines the action to take based on the current state of the environment. In the context of Halite, this would involve deciding the direction each ship should move to collect halite or return it to a shipyard.

* Critic: Estimates the value function of the current state, or in other words, it evaluates how good the current state is for the agent. This helps in adjusting the policy defined by the actor towards more rewarding actions.

## Step-by-Step Implementation:
* Environment Setup: Model the Halite game board as the environment. This includes the initial placement of halite, ships, and shipyards. The environment should be capable of updating its state based on the actions taken by the AI (actor) and providing feedback (rewards) to guide learning.

* State Representation: Define how the current game state will be represented to the neural network. This could include the positions of ships, the amount of halite in each location, the positions of shipyards, and any other relevant information.

* Action Space: Define the set of all possible actions that the AI can take at any point in time. In Halite, this would likely include moving ships in different directions, building new ships, and creating shipyards. (CONVERT', 'SPAWN', 'NORTH', 'SOUTH', 'EAST', 'WEST')

* Actor Network: Design a neural network to act as the actor. This network takes the current state as input and outputs a probability distribution over all possible actions, from which the next action is sampled.

* Critic Network: Design another neural network to act as the critic. It also takes the current state as input but outputs a scalar value representing the estimated value of that state.

* Reward Mechanism: Define a reward mechanism to provide feedback to the AI. In Halite, rewards can be based on the amount of halite collected, the amount of player owned halite, if the player has not been eliminated, else step_eliminated - episode_steps - 1

* Training Loop: Implement the training loop where the AI interacts with the environment, taking actions based on the actor's output, observing the new state and reward, and adjusting the networks based on the critic's evaluation.

* Evaluation and Optimization: Regularly evaluate the AI's performance by having it play full games against itself or predefined strategies. Use these evaluations to fine-tune the model's parameters and strategies.

* Experimentation: Experiment with different network architectures, hyperparameters, and reward functions to optimize performance.
